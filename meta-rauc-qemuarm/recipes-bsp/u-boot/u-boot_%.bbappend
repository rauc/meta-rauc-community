# qemuarm specific integration of u-boot for usage with RAUC
#
# While there are other ways to make u-boot aware of the multiboot setup (e.g. 
# by compiling env variables into it), this demo uses a bootscript-based approach.
# However, as the bootscript is provided alongside (and not as a part) of the
# u-boot binary, it needs to be deployed in a dedicated FAT partition.
#
# Besides, we adjust the boot sequence (just for convenience, to make things a bit faster).
#
# Regarding persistent bootloader environment: To mimic an application case that is closer
# to real-world scenarios we use the built-in flash (to be exact: pflash1) emulated by Qemu.
# It's parameters can be found at
#   https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/configs/qemu_arm_defconfig
# Note that in order for this to work, the kernel must be configured accordingly (with enabled
# MTD subsystem and physmap driver).
